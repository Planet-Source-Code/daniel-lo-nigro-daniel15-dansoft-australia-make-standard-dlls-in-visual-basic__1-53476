## Make Standard DLLs in Visual Basic


</div>

### Description

[The new version of this code is located at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=54190&lngWId=1]

Ever wanted to create your own API? Well, now you can! Using this program, you can make standard DLL's in Visual Basic, thus allowing you to do things previously only C++ and Delphi programmers can, including creating ISAPI scripts and control panel applets. You can create your own API and then use this API from any programming language that supports API calls! I created this because I saw a program that does the same thing but it costed $800!!!!!!!
